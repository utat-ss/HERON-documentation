Welcome to the Amateur Radio CommsSAT CubeSatellite Documentation
=====================================================

All of the code and some of the hardware design for our project can be found on the `UTAT Space Systems`_ GitHub. If you're currently on the GitHub, our documentation can also be viewed on `Read the Docs`_.

This documentation covers the software used on our satellite and some useful getting started information for new members. It has been created with the following goals in mind:

- To enable new UTAT SS members to quickly get up to speed and begin contributing to the codebase
- To document the functionality of the various libraries we develop
- To contain information regarding build instructions and debugging on our custom hardware

Our documentation is organized into the following sections:

- :ref:`getting-started`
- :ref:`software-and-programming`
- :ref:`electronics-and-altium`
